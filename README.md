# The project has 2 different distinct usage. We could not merge them but but i will tell you how both of the project works. 
# First one includes Receiver and Sender folders. After opening these folders, you can run both receiver.py and sender.py codes.
# You will face with 2 windows. On the sender window, you'll see your host name, you should write this name to receiver window(it says to write the host name). 
# Then, you should write the file name (DW) which is under the sender folder. In the receiver window, you can write any name for downloading. 
# In the end, when you check receiver folder, you will the file is transferred with 4 chunks.

------------------------

# Other project is under Network folder. You should open the 2 file with an IDE and run them inside this IDE. 
# This project searches available ip adresses to connect and share the data in json format with them.
# You should right click and run Networking.py first and then Networking_Clint.py.
# You will see 'New connection' message when a connection is established.
# You will see lots of timeout connection errors because some of the ip adresses is available to communicate.
# In the Networking_Client.py window, you will see data is shared with the connected clients.
# You can view both of them constantly while they are active
